# Portfolio Template

## Description
This website generates a random passphrase given a critera of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters that the user selects when prompted by an alert. The input is validated by type and size constraints. This challenge serves as the first application of JavaScript.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jakester101/supreme-winner.git
```

## Usage

This project deploys as an [HTML website](https://jakester101.github.io/supreme-winner). Press the "Generate Password" button to receive prompts for password criteria. The length must be between 8 and 128, and the character sets must be selected with a "yes" or a "no", or the program will exit with an error message.
